## Introduction

KreditCoin provides users with a completely anonymous payment scheme. KreditCoin implements the ring signature technology which allows you to sign a message on behalf of a group. The signature only proves the message was created by someone from the group, but all the possible signers are indistinguishable from each other. The more common digital signature for other cryptocurrencies involves verification via using a singular public key of the signer. KreditCoin Ring encryption does things a little differently, we use several different public keys for verification. The verification system uses a group of users at once to verify transactions making use of each user in the group's public and private keys. Since Ring signatures use more than one Public key to sign each transaction it becomes impossible to prove who was originally conducting the transaction, resulting in a 100% anonymous system.
